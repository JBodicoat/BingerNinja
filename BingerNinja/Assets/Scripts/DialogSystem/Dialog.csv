1,Ninjas'R'Us,Ninja'r Us,Binger welcome back to field work!,It's been a while so I'll go over the basics in case you forgot.,In the Top-Left of your HUD, you'll see your health and hunger bars.,Remember if your hunger drops to zero, your health will start to decay.,Luckily, this building has a lot of food everywhere. You can eat food that you pick up in order to relieve your hunger level.,Looks like the elevator has no power. You need to find a way to turn it on.,The door to your right looks like it’s locked. You’ll need to find a key. Try the room on your left.,,
1,Security Guard,,You can use that food to attack enemies. Give it a go now!,Pick up the squid, get close to the target, and press left mouse click to hit them with it!,,,,,,,,
1,Eating Trigger,,Careful Binger! Remember what I said about hunger.,Pick up that squid and press E to eat it.,,,,,,,,,,
1,Hiding Trigger,,Quick, that guard hasn’t spotted you yet. Hide!,You can hide behind objects by walking by them and pressing F.,,,,,,,,,
1,After Hiding,,I'm surprised that tree hid you, given it's only the size of your arm... I guess believing in yourself really IS the key to success!,You still need to turn on the elevator. Explore the rest of the floor and see what you can find.,Now that you've remembered the basics, make your way to the next floor. Also, for some reason, like an escalator, each elevator only goes between 2 floors. Have fun with that!,,,,
2,Level 2 Start,,Binger, this floor seems to have some different foods to the previous one. These foods make great projectiles. Good for defeating your foes at range.,I know parting with food is a foreign concept to you, but please give it a try.,Oh, and remember, you can only hold one food item at a time.,,,,,
2,Projectile Trigger,,Practice throwing the food at the businessmen in the next room. Pick up the rice ball and left mouse click to throw it.,,,,,,,,,,,
2,Businessman Intro,,Careful you don’t get spotted, Binger. Businessmen don’t take kindly to outsiders,They also look busy so might try to get rid of you quickly.,,,,,,,,,
2,Enemies defeated,,Nice throw! He doesn't even know what hit hi- BINGER, DON'T EVEN THINK OF EATING THAT OFF OF HIM!,Right, time to make your way to the elevator. Be careful, My sensors are showing something strange on the floor above you.,,,,,,,
