1,Ninjas'R'Us,Ninjas'R'Us,Binger welcome back to field work!,It's been a while so I'll go over the basics in case you forgot.,"In the Top-Left of your HUD, you'll see your health and hunger bars.","Remember if your hunger drops to zero, your health will start to decay.","Luckily, this building has a lot of food everywhere. You can eat food that you pick up in order to relieve your hunger level.",Looks like the elevator has no power. You need to find a way to turn it on.,The door to your right looks like it’s locked. You’ll need to find a key. Try the room on your left.
1,Security Guard,Ninjas'R'Us,You can use that food to attack enemies. Give it a go now!,"Pick up the squid, get close to the target, and press left mouse click to hit them with it!",,,,,

1,After Hiding,Ninjas'R'Us,"I'm surprised that tree hid you, given it's only the size of your arm... I guess believing in yourself really IS the key to success!",You still need to turn on the elevator. Explore the rest of the floor and see what you can find.,"Now that you've remembered the basics, make your way to the next floor. Also, for some reason, like an escalator, each elevator only goes between 2 floors. Have fun with that!",,,,
2,Level 2 Start,Ninjas'R'Us,"Binger, this floor seems to have some different foods to the previous one. These foods make great projectiles. Good for defeating your foes at range.","I know parting with food is a foreign concept to you, but please give it a try.","Oh, and remember, you can only hold one food item at a time.",,,,
2,Projectile Trigger,Ninjas'R'Us,Practice throwing the food at the businessmen in the next room. Pick up the rice ball and left mouse click to throw it.,,,,,,
2,Businessman Intro,Ninjas'R'Us,"Careful you don’t get spotted, Binger. Businessmen don’t take kindly to outsiders",They also look busy so might try to get rid of you quickly.,,,,,

3,Pre Fight,Business Barry,"Ah, I had heard there was some commotion on the lower levels. I don't know what all the fuss was about but it ends here."," Allow me to offer you a one-time business deal. You leave now, and I'll pay you in my special currency called 'Not-beating-you-to-a-pulp-bucks?' No? OK...",,,,,
3,Tutorial,Ninjas'R'Us,"Be careful Binger. He looks almost as dangerous as your calorie intake! Let me analyse him quickly... Hmmm. Quick-thinker, not afraid to take risks, twice your height...",It may be better to avoid a face to face fight here!,,,,,
3,Tutorial Part 2,Ninjas'R'Us,Hide behind objects and wait for him to get close. Then press [Key/Button] to perform a sneak attack.,,,,,,
3,BusinessBarry,Business Barry,"It seems inflation has lowered the value of my currency... That's a shame, since I don't make that much money, and they were all I had to pay for my children's meals with...","Go now, but you won't get far. This office building is not all it seems from the outside.",,,,,
4,Level 4 start,Ninjas'R'Us,"Binger, I see you found the kitchens... Why am I not surprised?","There aren't as many tall objects here. Luckily, those worktops look just the right height to crouch behind and keep you out of sight of passing enemies. I'll pray for your knees!",,,,,
4,Crouch,Ninjas'R'Us,"Press [Key] to crouch. You won't be able to move or attack though so crouch wisely, young grasshopper! Press [Key] to stand back up when you're ready.",,,,,,

6,Head Chef,Chef Cordon,WHERE’S THE LAMB SAU- oh… You’re not my apprentice. I guess I’ll have to vent my frustration on you then…,,,,,,
6,Head chef intro,Ninjas'R'Us,Be careful Binger. This head chef looks like he won’t even feel a frontal attack. I guess all those years of apprentices spilling hot things down him have paid off for him…,"Remember, Chefs are sensitive to cold after spending all that time in hot kitchens.",,,,,
6,Freezer button,Ninjas'R'Us,That button looks like it’s connected to the walk-in freezer… Maybe you can use that to defeat him!,Press [Key] to interact with buttons.,,,,,
