1,Ninjas'R'Us,Ninjas'R'Us,Binger welcome back to field work!,It's been a while so I'll go over the basics in case you forgot.,"In the Top-Left of your HUD, you'll see your health and hunger bars.","Remember if your hunger drops to zero, your health will start to decay.","Luckily, this building has a lot of food everywhere. You can eat food that you pick up in order to relieve your hunger level.",Looks like the elevator has no power. You need to find a way to turn it on.,The door to your right looks like it’s locked. You’ll need to find a key. Try the room on your left.
1,Security Guard,Ninjas'R'Us,You can use that food to attack enemies. Give it a go now!,"Pick up the squid, get close to the target, and press left mouse click to hit them with it!",,,,,
1,Eating Trigger,Ninjas'R'Us,Careful Binger! Remember what I said about hunger.,Pick up that squid and press E to eat it.,,,,,
1,Hiding Trigger,Ninjas'R'Us,"Quick, that guard hasn’t spotted you yet. Hide!",You can hide behind objects by walking by them and pressing F.,,,,,
1,After Hiding,Ninjas'R'Us,"I'm surprised that tree hid you, given it's only the size of your arm... I guess believing in yourself really IS the key to success!",You still need to turn on the elevator. Explore the rest of the floor and see what you can find.,"Now that you've remembered the basics, make your way to the next floor. Also, for some reason, like an escalator, each elevator only goes between 2 floors. Have fun with that!",,,,
2,Level 2 Start,Ninjas'R'Us,"Binger, this floor seems to have some different foods to the previous one. These foods make great projectiles. Good for defeating your foes at range.","I know parting with food is a foreign concept to you, but please give it a try.","Oh, and remember, you can only hold one food item at a time.",,,,
2,Projectile Trigger,Ninjas'R'Us,Practice throwing the food at the businessmen in the next room. Pick up the rice ball and left mouse click to throw it.,,,,,,
2,Businessman Intro,Ninjas'R'Us,"Careful you don’t get spotted, Binger. Businessmen don’t take kindly to outsiders",They also look busy so might try to get rid of you quickly.,,,,,
2,EndLevelTwo,Ninjas'R'Us,"Nice throw! He doesn't even know what hit hi- BINGER, DON'T EVEN THINK OF EATING THAT OFF OF HIM!","Right, time to make your way to the elevator. Be careful, My sensors are showing something strange on the floor above you.",,,,,
3,Pre Fight,Business Barry,"Ah, I had heard there was some commotion on the lower levels. I don't know what all the fuss was about but it ends here."," Allow me to offer you a one-time business deal. You leave now, and I'll pay you in my special currency called 'Not-beating-you-to-a-pulp-bucks?' No? OK...",,,,,
3,Tutorial,Ninjas'R'Us,"Be careful Binger. He looks almost as dangerous as your calorie intake! Let me analyse him quickly... Hmmm. Quick-thinker, not afraid to take risks, twice your height...",It may be better to avoid a face to face fight here!,,,,,
3,Tutorial Part 2,Ninjas'R'Us,Hide behind objects and wait for him to get close. Then press [Key/Button] to perform a sneak attack.,,,,,,
3,BusinessBarry,Business Barry,"It seems inflation has lowered the value of my currency... That's a shame, since I don't make that much money, and they were all I had to pay for my children's meals with...","Go now, but you won't get far. This office building is not all it seems from the outside.",,,,,
4,Level 4 Start,Ninjas'R'Us,"Binger, I see you found the kitchens... Why am I not surprised?","There aren't as many tall objects here. Luckily, those worktops look just the right height to crouch behind and keep you out of sight of passing enemies. I'll pray for your knees!",,,,,
4,Crouch,Ninjas'R'Us,"Press [Key] to crouch. You won't be able to move or attack though so crouch wisely, young grasshopper! Press [Key] to stand back up when you're ready.",,,,,,
4,Chef intro,Ninjas'R'Us,Be on high alert here. Chefs are an angry type of people. They don’t need an excuse to throw their knives at you.,,,,,,
5,Level 5 start,Ninjas'R'Us,I've taken a look at the layout of this floor. It looks like there are some vents you can use to sneak around more easily.,,,,,,
5,Vents,Ninjas'R'Us,{Press [Key]} to enter the vent. You'll automatically pop out the other side when you get there.,,,,,,
5,Exit Vent,Ninjas'R'Us,"Ah, the miracle of ninja-birth! Congratulations it's a... Disappointment.",,,,,,
5,Barista Intro,Ninjas'R'Us,These baristas appear to be wearing aprons... Looks like a frontal attack won't be effective.,,,,,,
6,Head Chef,Chef Cordon,WHERE’S THE LAMB SAU- oh… You’re not my apprentice. I guess I’ll have to vent my frustration on you then…,,,,,,
6,Head chef intro,Ninjas'R'Us,Be careful Binger. This head chef looks like he won’t even feel a frontal attack. I guess all those years of apprentices spilling hot things down him have paid off for him…,"Remember, Chefs are sensitive to cold after spending all that time in hot kitchens.",,,,,
6,Freezer button,Ninjas'R'Us,That button looks like it’s connected to the walk-in freezer… Maybe you can use that to defeat him!,Press [Key] to interact with buttons.,,,,,
6,Head Chef,Chef Cordon,"I can’t believe I let you lock me in the freezer so many times… Cover me in bread, because I feel like an idiot sandwich",,,,,,
7,Level 7 into,Ninjas'R'Us,"Ok Binger, I see some control panels on the wall here. You’ll have to experiment to see what they do, but they’re similar to buttons.",,,,,,
7,Janitor warning,Ninjas'R'Us,Careful around those Janitors. They won’t need to get as close to hit you with those brooms.,,,,,,
8,Intern intro,Ninjas'R'Us,I guess those Interns are eager to impress. They’re speeding around!,"Aww, they look like they’re all tuckered out. Bless them.",,,,,
9,Tech Boss,Tech Man,"A ninja? Oh how quaint! You can keep all your ancient techniques to yourself, I don’t need them. My tech is superior. I. AM. THE. FUTURE.",,,,,,
9,Tech intro,Ninjas'R'Us,"Binger, does he look familiar to you? I know him from somewhere…",Where was it? Where was - oh! He was the one who hacked our network a few years ago.,Be careful. He’s a very tricky person!,,,,
9,Distractions,Ninjas'R'Us,He seems easily distracted. Try using this to your advantage,{distracting projectile} can be used to distract enemies. Making them lose interest in you for a short time.,,,,,
9,Tech Boss,Tech Man,"I don’t understand… Past. Present. Future… How can I, the future, lose to a ninja? A relic of the past?...","I suppose they must have a place, that’s why we sent them to - never mind. Can’t have you knowing all of our secrets.",,,,,
