0,Ninjas'R'Us,Binger welcome back to field work!,It's been a while so I'll go over the basics in case you forgot.,"In the Top-Left of your HUD, you'll see your health and hunger bars.","Remember if your hunger drops to zero, your health will start to decay.","Luckily, this building has a lot of food everywhere. You can eat food that you pick up in order to relieve your hunger level.",Looks like the elevator has no power. You need to find a way to turn it on.,The door to your right looks like it’s locked. You’ll need to find a key. Try the room on your right.
0,Level 2 Start,"Binger, this floor seems to have some different foods to the previous one. These foods make great projectiles. Good for defeating your foes at range.","I know parting with food is a foreign concept to you, but please give it a try.""","Oh, and remember, you can only hold one food item at a time.",,,,

Also, for some reason, like an escalator, each elevator only goes between 2 floors. Have fun with that!!",,,,
